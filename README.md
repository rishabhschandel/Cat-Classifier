# Cat-Classifier

In this project a model is trained to recognize images of cat. So given an Image model will predict whether it is a cat(1) or not a cat(0).
Logistic regression model as a simplest possible nueral network is trained on 209 images and tested on 50 images. Each image is of (64,64,3) dimensions.
Model accuracy on training set is of th range 96-99%.
Model accuracy on test set is in the range of 70-75%.
